This is ongoing project.


## Parsing
Parsing done on LLama Cloud
Downloaded 15 pdfs and will add a detailed README of this project to start with. Should also implement a pipeline for pdf upload too.

Used the api of Llama cloud to LlamaParse and saved in markdown, also extracted images from parsing and ran through multimodal model, qwen 2.5 to generate a caption to give a context about the model. These caption context are appened to markdown. I also used the same model to get some metadata about the papers for some metadata context.

Added line `###### Image captions` so I can use markdown splitter to generate metadata that it belongs to an image and also generated by model.

## Database Construction
Using milvus lite to make the database. Implementing Hybrid Search approach.


## Upgrades/Future Works
- Can replace Docling instead of llamaparse for fully local system
